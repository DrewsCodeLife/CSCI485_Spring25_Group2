The number (e.g. "Mainline VDS '715898'...") is the station ID. This is important for later lookup to show results on a graph and for other lookup purposes.


### VARIABLES ###

Flow: Vehicles / 5 minutes
Occupancy: % Lane full (e.g. bumper-to-bumper is 100)
Speed: Vehicle Speed in Mph
Q: Vehicle Miles Traveled / Vehicle Hours Traveled


On Ramp sensors only have Flow & Occupancy
Mainline sensors have all 4 variables.

location Coordinates were gathered using the relevant map from PeMS, finding the same location on google maps (using surrounding streets to specify location), and then fetching the coordinates of the predicted position. "Mainline" or "On Ramp" is from PeMS and refers to the specific road location. I believe Mainline simply refers to the main highway through LA? In particular, we are looking at I5-North (maybe South too?), for only district 7 (which is the LA area)

```
715898 - 33.880149, -118.021730 - Mainline
715901 - 33.883681, -118.027733 - On Ramp
762355 - 33.883681, -118.027733 - Off Ramp - Map location same as 715901
716899 - 33.883681, -118.027733 - Mainline - Map location same as 715901, perhaps an array of sensors in one station
716900 - 33.887208, -118.033784 - Mainline
715903 - 33.887208, -118.033784 - On Ramp - Same location as 716900
762353 - 33.890681, -118.040822 - Mainline
775012 - 33.892658, -118.044406 - Mainline
716904 - 33.894742, -118.048204 - Mainline
716903 - 33.894742, -118.048204 - Off Ramp - Same location as 716904
715905 - 33.894742, -118.048204 - On Ramp - Same location as 716904
718358 - 33.897164, -118.052409 - Mainline
769625 - 33.900495, -118.058289 - Mainline
769626 - 33.900495, -118.058289 - Off Ramp - Same location as 769625
762357 - 33.905090, -118.065005 - Off Ramp
718081 - 33.905090, -118.065005 - Mainline - Same location as 762357
718360 - 33.907708, -118.067623 - Mainline
```

All in all, these stations are spread across about 3 miles (3.01 miles as measured by google maps), as the bird flies, along I5-N



On PeMS: "Roadway Information (from TSN)" -- probably just repetitive, but tracking it may catch if the road changes in some way:
