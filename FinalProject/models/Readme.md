### 💡 Why Flow from Other Stations Helps

#### 🛣️ 1. Traffic is a networked system
	•	If there’s congestion upstream, it will likely propagate downstream.
	•	For example:
	•	If Station A is seeing a spike in flow, Station B (a few miles down) might see that same spike 5–10 minutes later.
	•	Or, a slowdown at a ramp could cause spillback to a mainline.

#### 🔁 2. ARIMA alone is univariate
	•	It only learns from the past values of one station.
	•	It has no idea what’s happening at nearby stations — even though that might predict the future at your target station better.

#### 🧠 3. Adding other stations’ flow gives you predictive context
	•	For XGBoost, you can include:
	•	Lagged flow from nearby stations (flow_t-1_station_1, flow_t-2_station_2)
	•	Rolling averages of upstream station
	•	For ARIMAX (ARIMA with exogenous variables), you can pass those other flows as exog.
